#CS303 Assignment 3

Instructions:
This program will ask the user to either test the Infix to Postfix Conversion or the Queue or if you would like to quit the program. If you choose the option to test the Infix to Postfix Conversion, the program will ask the user to input the infix. If input is not in the correct format, it will output an error message and go back to the options screen again. If the format is correct, it will output the postfix. If you choose to test the Queue, it will ask the user to either: enqueue, dequeue, check size, check front element, check if the queue is empty, or quit. Choosing enqueue, it will ask the user to input a number to enqueue. Choosing dequeue will dequeue the queue. Choosing check size will output the size of the queue. Choosing check front element will output the front element of the queue. Choosing check if queue is empty will output whether or not the queue is empty. Choosing quit will quit the test and go back to the options screen. If the user is finished with testing, choosing the option to quit will end the program.
